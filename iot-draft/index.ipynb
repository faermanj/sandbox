    "Welcome to the Learning AWS IoT course! Here we will practice how to build solutions for the internet of things. Like in many business, our focus is to build connected devices and applications, not manage servers. We'll leverage  managed cloud services to remove the undiferentiated heavy lifting and focus on the business logic. However, we still concern in understanding how security, scalability and other requirements are fulfilled. \n",

You can execute a cell by selecting it and using the \"run\" menu action or shift+enter shortcut. Make sure you execute every cell in order, as each one defines variables or creates resources for the next one. But don't just execute the cell - the whole point of this workshop is undestanding what each of them do. Any system supporting python and bash should be sufficient to run the notebooks in this course. I recommend using https://mybinder.org"
